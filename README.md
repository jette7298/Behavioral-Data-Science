This repository includes projects I worked on during my master's degree in Behavioral Data Science at University of Amsterdam.

__Human Faces Recogniton__
I build an algorithm that is able to recognize emotions from photographs from facial expressions. 
The data set contains photos of faces that express one of the following emotions:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Happyness
- Sadness

__Physical Activity Recognition__

I build a classifier that recognizes different types of physical activity from signals measured by the accelerometer and gyroscope in your smartphone, 
which both measure aspects of movement and orientation. The data for this competition were collected in a lab using a basic smartphone in experiments 
with human participants carrying out various daily activities in set order.

__Offensive Tweet Detection__
I build a classifier that automatically recognize tweets that contain offensive language, are derogatory or hateful.
